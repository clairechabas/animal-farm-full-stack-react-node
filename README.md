# üêª Animal Farm

A search engine for animals.

A full stack application built with React and Vite on the front-end and Node.js and Express on the backend.

The app uses [Chance](https://chancejs.com/) an open source minimalist generator of random [1] strings, numbers, etc. to help reduce some monotony particularly while writing automated tests or anywhere else you need anything random.

It was built following a course on React on [Fireship.io](https://fireship.io/).
